## Abra

Abra describes recursive trinary dataflow. It is a dataflow-oriented
computation language. Abra is composed of lookup tables and trit vectors,
which are combined to create functions and branches,
which may be recursive. Branches attached to environments are called
entities. The inputs to and outputs from entities are called effects.
Effects which are sent to environments defined by entity metadata affect
other entities belonging to those environments. Branches are defined as
a list of sizes of inputs, and a list of dataflow sites which may be
marked as stateful and output.

#### Goals

Abra should be trivial to execute by an IoT device. Thus, the encoding
given here should modify only to reduce the complexity for an IoT device
to run it. Functionality of higher-level languages should be transformed
and reduced to lower-level constructs to make for simpler execution.

#### Terms

 * *Environment*: an address to which effects are sent. Effects are
    length-extended or cropped, depending on Entity input size.
 * *Entity*: an entrypoint branch which receives input effects from many
    environments, sends output effects to many environments.
 * *Effect*: a non-null trit vector sent between entities.
 * *Lookup Table*: 3-input, 1-output, which only returns a non-null value
    where defined.
 * *Branch*: much like a function in traditional programming paradigms. It
    can have state, and can recursively invoke itself. Recursive
    invocations of branches are new instances of the branch. If it is
    stateful, then it is a new state in each recursive path. It has an
    exact input size and an exact return size. Its output is serialized
    as each site marked as "output" in the order it appears.
 * *Knot*: an invocation of a branch which outputs to a site in the
    dataflow of a branch.
 * *Site*: a vertex in our dataflow graph within a branch, representing a
    result of a branch invocation, or a merging of other sites.
 * *Memory Latch*: a stateful site whose new value will be usable in the
    next invocation of the same branch.
 * *Merge*: in a water analogy, a wye terminating in one output. Multiple
    sites can be selected from, where the merging site's value will be
    the unique non-null vector of the many site inputs to the merger.

#### Trit encoding spec

Attachment metadata:

We have a list of entities and their attachment metadata. Incoming, they
have a `limit`, per belonging environment, on the number of times they
may be invoked in a time `quant` (positive integer). They have a `delay`
in number of `quants`, per outgoing environment, before the effects will
affect the entities of that environment. They have a maximum `depth` of
recursion, counted as the maximum number of branches which may be
attached. A depth of `0` will not traverse any branches.

Additionally, each environment attachment has an associated window of inputs/outputs by starting and last index of inputs/outputs. In this manner, a branch can receive inputs from separate environments.

Attachment transactions are kept separate from the dataflow definition
transactions for purposes of reusability, to keep entities
(instantiations) separate from branches (definitions).

#### LUT definition

The lookup table is encoded as 27 nullable trits, which fits in a 35
-trit number as 27 binary-coded trits. A lookup table which returns
0 for any input would look, in binary, like `3F_FF_FF_FF_FF`.

Since this value only covers for any non-null possible inputs, we start
encoding by starting at all negatives (first input as lowest-endian),
`---`, and continuing to increment: `0--`, `1--`, `-0-`, `00-`, `10-`,
..., `111`.

Thus, the most-significant pair of bits (binary-coded trits) corresponds
to `111`, and the least significant pair of bits corresponds to `---`.

This final value is treated as a binary number, and encoded within a
35-trit vector.

#### Merge / Knot / Sites

A merge has all input sites of identical length; but a knot (a branch
invocation) would simply take all vectors as little-endian-packed input,
as `b(xxxxyyyyzzzzzz)`.

A knot's definition (as opposed to inputs) may be defined by any of the
blocks listed in the definition - branch, lookup table, or externally
imported block (which may be lookup table or branch).

In a branch, because these are packed to little-endian, n input vectors
could be concatenated or shuffled to select, concatenate, or rearrange
by ordering of sites which each merge one input index, and marking the
site as output to the branch. In a concatenation example, it uses no
lookup tables. A branch which selects a range of trits at an offset
which changes dependent on one of its inputs (an index), however, may
have many input sites of 1-trit vectors, and use many lookup tables and
mergers.

#### Importing branch definitions from external sites

An external site import will occupy n indices for the declared number of
imported sites. When a branch is used in a site (knot), these external
sites will occupy that portion.

##### Inputs to knot/merge

A site in the dataflow graph is wired feed-forward. However, memory
latches may be used anywhere within a branch, and as they are declared
last, they may be used by other sites for the definition of their new value.
With the exception of memory latches, whose value previously defined is
used, any index declared as an input to a merge or branch must be less
than the current site index (starting from the first input site, through
body sites, output sites, and memory latch sites)

If the site being defined is a memory latch, it may use any other index
from the rest of the branch as an input, including other memory latches.
This is because the resulting value will only be set on a memory latch
after the branch is invoked.

All other sites (body, output) may only use site indices less than their
current index, such that there is no possibility of cycles (which may
possibly not settle) in a branch.

#### Encoding
Positive integers (as listed above) are encoded as binary.1/-, little
endian, terminated with 0.

Site indices may be positive or negative, so the minimum number of trits
to encode the site is given first (positive integer), followed by the
site value. `0` indicates both 0 trits and the value `0`. `101` encodes
`1`, `10-` encodes `minus 1`, `1101--` encodes `minus 11`.

##### To determine
Changes to this spec may be necessary to determine fitness for the
following:

1. Distributed Computing - may be defined in branches and metadata
2. Parallel Computing
3. Concurrent Computing
4. Real-time Computing
5. Lockstep Computing
6. Virtualization
7. ANN-friendliness
